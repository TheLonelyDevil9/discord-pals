# Changelog

All notable changes to Discord Pals will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [v1.8.6] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **Other bots' messages missing from user-only context** — In user-only mode, ALL bot/app messages from other bots were completely discarded, making replies to other bots and bot-bot conversations nonsensical. Now includes the last 5 messages from each other bot/app in the channel, formatted as user-role entries with author prefix to prevent personality bleed. Current bot's own last 3 assistant turns still kept separately.

## [v1.8.5] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **Multiple tags only producing one reply** — Duplicate detection scanned history for ANY bot response after a user message, falsely concluding the bot already responded to queued messages. When messages A, B, C were queued and A's response appeared after B and C in history, B and C were silently skipped. Replaced fragile history-scanning with a precise set-based tracker of processed message IDs.

## [v1.8.4] - 2026-03-19

### Changed

- **Documentation overhaul** — Comprehensive README.md update to match v1.8.x codebase:
  - Rewrote Memory Architecture section from legacy 5-tier to current 2-store system (auto memories + manual lore)
  - Added 6 missing slash commands to Commands tables (`/switch`, `/pause`, `/nickname-trigger`, `/ignore`, `/unignore`, `/ignorelist`)
  - Added 6 missing runtime config settings (user-only context, DM follow-ups)
  - Updated Dashboard section descriptions (Memories, Config, Logs pages)
  - Expanded File Structure to include all 22 Python modules and commands/ folder
  - Added DM Follow-ups and Scoped Nickname Triggers subsections to Autonomous Mode
  - Updated Features list with user-only context, DM follow-ups, user ignore system, killswitch command
  - Fixed context viewer polling interval reference (3s → 10s)
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md with project structure notes for new contributors

## [v1.8.3] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **Auto Channels stat counting stale entries** — dashboard stat included channels from `autonomous.json` that bots can no longer access (deleted channels, left servers); now filters against actually accessible channels

## [v1.8.2] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **LLM responding as generic assistant** — `user_only_context` defaulted to `True` in v1.8.0, immediately stripping all assistant turns for all users; LLMs lost roleplay pattern and defaulted to "helpful assistant" mode regardless of system prompt; now defaults to `False` (opt-in via dashboard)
- **User-only mode now keeps last 3 assistant turns** — instead of only 1 (v1.8.1), now keeps the current bot's last 3 responses interleaved chronologically with user messages; provides stronger conversational anchoring while still discarding other bots and older history
- **Synthetic first-turn fallback** — when user-only mode is enabled and the bot has never responded in a channel, injects a synthetic assistant turn from the character's `example_dialogue` to maintain roleplay pattern; skips gracefully if no example dialogue exists
- **Context viewer scroll position preserved** — increased poll interval from 3s to 10s and added content hashing; DOM only updates when context actually changes, preventing mid-scroll jumps

### Changed

- Renamed `context_message_count` to `user_only_context_count` for clarity (default: 20)

## [v1.8.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **LLM refusing to roleplay** — user-only context mode was stripping ALL assistant messages, leaving the LLM with zero conversational flow; now keeps the current bot's most recent response as a single assistant turn for anchoring while still discarding all other bot/assistant messages

## [v1.8.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Autonomous DM follow-ups** — bots send organic follow-up messages in DMs after configurable silence periods; timeout, max count, and cooldown all adjustable from dashboard
- **Scoped nickname triggers** — per-channel toggle (default OFF) for name-based triggers; new `/nickname-trigger` slash command and dashboard toggle in Channels page; bot only responds to @mentions/replies unless explicitly enabled
- **User-only context mode** — based on "Do LLMs Benefit From Their Own Words?" paper; discards ALL bot/assistant messages from LLM context, sending only the last N human user messages; drastically reduces impersonation and context poisoning
- **Unified memory system** — consolidated 5 memory stores (server, DM, user, global profiles, lore) into 2 (auto memories + manual lore); automatic migration from legacy stores on startup with .bak backups
- **LLM-based memory deduplication** — after 5 new auto memories for the same user key, an LLM consolidates and removes redundant entries
- **Manual lore system** — lore can be attached to users, bots, or servers; add/edit/delete via dashboard or `/lore` command with type selection
- **Mass delete for memories and lore** — checkbox selection + "Delete Selected" in dashboard for both auto memories and manual lore
- **New v2 memory API endpoints** — `/api/v2/memories/auto`, `/api/v2/memories/lore` with filtering, batch delete, and add/edit support

### Changed

- **Context system** — `format_history_split()` now supports `user_only` mode that filters out all bot messages; `is_bot` flag added to history entries for filtering
- **Memory commands** — `/memory`, `/memories`, `/lore`, and `/clearmemories` simplified to work with unified 2-store system
- **Dashboard** — Memories page tabs renamed to "Auto Memories" and "Manual Lore"; Config page gets new "User-Only Context" toggle, "Context Message Count" slider, and "DM Follow-ups" section

### Fixed

- **Queue/generation bug** — `add_to_history()` hash dedup now includes `message_id` to prevent different Discord messages with same content from being silently dropped
- **Duplicate detection hardening** — `_build_request_context()` content-based fallback now skipped when message_id is available; `already_in_history` check uses message_id exclusively
- **Per-user pending limit** — increased from 2 to 3 in request queue to prevent legitimate requests from being dropped

## [v1.7.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- **OpenRouter first-class support** — auto-detects OpenRouter URLs and injects `HTTP-Referer` and `X-OpenRouter-Title` headers for leaderboard attribution
- **Per-provider `openrouter` config** — optional dict field merged into API request body, supporting provider routing (`order`, `ignore`, `allow_fallbacks`, `sort`, `data_collection`), model fallbacks (`models` array), and context compression (`transforms: ["middle-out"]`)
- **OpenRouter settings in dashboard** — JSON textarea in Edit/Add Provider modals, auto-shown when endpoint URL contains `openrouter.ai`
- **OpenRouter documentation** — new README section with config examples and common options

## [v1.6.19] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- **Per-provider timeout** - Each provider can now have its own `"timeout"` field (5-3600s) that overrides the global timeout. Prevents slow providers (e.g., local LLMs) from being cut off mid-generation while keeping fast cloud APIs on shorter timeouts.
- **Timeout field in dashboard** - Edit Provider modal and Add Provider form now include a timeout input field.
- **Dashboard-first development principle** added to CLAUDE.md.

### Fixed

- **Dashboard dropping global config fields** - `saveProvidersToServer()` was reconstructing JSON as `{ providers: [...] }` only, discarding the global `timeout` and `character_providers` fields. Now preserves all top-level fields when saving via the UI.

## [v1.6.18] - 2026-03-05

### Reverted

- **Hard reset to v1.6.4 baseline** due to stability issues in v1.6.5-v1.6.17
- Removed complex mention/tagging system (`context_protocol.py`, `mention_resolver.py`)
- Removed protocol handle abstraction (@u_123, @b_456 system)
- Removed alias cache persistence (`user_alias_cache.json`)
- Removed history sequence numbers
- Removed cross-store memory deduplication (O(n²) performance issue)
- Removed auto-memory user mention validation and auto-prefixing
- Removed relation-based tag fallback system
- Removed tag intent detection via regex + stopwords
- Removed 11 test files for reverted features

### Added (cherry-picked from v1.6.17)

- **Memory fingerprint-based deduplication** - SHA256 hash-based exact duplicate detection (per-store only)
  - `_memory_fingerprint()` - Generate 24-char hash for each memory
  - `_sanitize_memory_content()` - Normalize content before storage
  - `_sanitize_memory_entries()` - Validate and deduplicate memory lists
  - `_contains_fingerprint()` - Fast fingerprint checking
  - All `add_*_memory()` methods now generate and store fingerprints
  - Fingerprint check added as Stage 0 in `_is_duplicate_memory()` (instant exact match detection)
- **Improved emoji sanitization patterns** for malformed custom emojis:
  - `RE_INCOMPLETE_TAG` - Catches `<:name:id` without closing `>`
  - `RE_MALFORMED_EMOJI_PREFIX` - Catches malformed emoji prefixes
  - Updated `RE_BROKEN_EMOJI_END` - Better incomplete emoji detection (now handles `<a:name:id` patterns)
  - Updated `RE_ORPHAN_SNOWFLAKE` - Avoids false positives on mentions (excludes `@#&/` prefixes)
  - Enhanced `convert_emojis_in_text()` with targeted cleanup and whitespace normalization

### Changed

- Memory deduplication simplified to per-store only (no cross-store checking for performance)
- Emoji cleanup now uses multiple targeted patterns instead of one aggressive regex
- `convert_emojis_in_text()` now handles `None` text input gracefully

### Notes

- This release prioritizes **stability and reliability** over feature richness
- Mention system reverted to v1.6.4 baseline (basic @user pings work, no advanced tagging)
- Context system rework planned for future release with focus on simplicity
- Total lines removed: ~6,000 (from 28 files)
- Total lines added: ~200 (dedup + emoji improvements)

## [v1.6.4] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Disabled `RE_MALFORMED_EMOJI` regex in `convert_emojis_in_text()` — pattern was too aggressive, matching legitimate `<...>` text (up to 50 chars) and truncating messages mid-sentence. `RE_BROKEN_EMOJI_END` still handles incomplete emoji at string end.

## [v1.6.3] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- @mention system now includes comprehensive debug logging — logs mentionable user list, lookup table, pattern matches, and conversion results for troubleshooting
- @mention regex now uses lookahead `(?=\W|$)` instead of `\b` word boundary — fixes matching issues with display names containing emojis or special characters
- `get_mentionable_users()` now falls back to guild members when history is sparse (< 3 users) — ensures mentionable list is populated even in new channels or after history clears
- `get_mentionable_users()` now accepts optional `guild` parameter for member fallback — passed from `bot_instance.py` context

## [v1.6.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- Dashboard memory stats no longer count history cache messages as "manual" memories — `history_cache.json` was not excluded due to filename mismatch in filter
- @mention conversion now handles AI-generated `<@Name>` patterns — normalizes to `@Name` before conversion, preventing malformed `<<@id>>` output
- Bot's own responses now resolve mentions back to display names in history — passes guild context so the AI sees `@DisplayName` instead of generic `@user` in its own past messages

## [v1.6.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- Dynamic provider tier ordering — tiers beyond "primary/secondary/fallback" now work correctly instead of silently falling back to primary
- @mention replacement handles multi-word display names and no longer strips valid mentions via the safety net
- Bot responds after `/clear` — auto-recall from Discord API is suppressed when history was explicitly cleared
- Impersonation stripping enhanced — catches mid-response `Name:` lines, `*Name says*` roleplay patterns, and sources other bot names from the registry (not just history)
- Reply detection falls back to `fetch_message()` when Discord cache misses, name triggers work without autonomous mode, and duplicate detection uses message IDs instead of content matching
